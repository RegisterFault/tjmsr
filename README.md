# tjmsr
My tinkering with intel MSRs.

## WARNING:
***DO NOT USE THESE PROGRAMS WITHOUT ENSURING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THEY DO***

This is a tinkering repository and I may very much commit code that works on my machines but breaks others. I tinker with MSRs, bypass drivers, and require root access, and this is all mostly disgusting, shameless, quick and dirty code anyways. What you see here is not and will never be finished product, what you see is proofs of concepts and tinkering, largely in an effort to improve understandings needed by nMonitor development.
